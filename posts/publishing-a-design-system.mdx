## What I have learned after creating a design system

In this article, I have written down the essential steps that go into publishing your design system. I wrote most of this
as documentation for other web developers on the project whilest working on the project.

## Local package testing

Before publishing your new package version you would ideally test out the package locally, this is possible with the
[yarn link](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/link) command. This command creates a [symlink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link)
inside of your ~/.config/yarn/link directory on your machine to your local package that you can use inside your project
to test locally without publishing.

### Creating a symlink for your package

We start off by going into the separate design system package directory via our terminal, where we then run a custom yarn script
that makes the design system package globally available for use in any project.

**_Custom script to link your package_**

```bash
yarn link-package
```

**_The script above executes the following:_**

```bash
yarn build && yarn link
```

- yarn build builds your project so that it can be used
- yarn link creates the symlink to your package

### Connecting to your package symlink

In order to connect to the design system package symlink, you first have to go inside the project you want to test the design system
package in via your terminal. Once there you run a simple yarn link command as follows, where you replace the PACKAGE_NAME with
the name of the package:

```bash
yarn link "PACKAGE_NAME"
```

Now that you have connected to the symlink you can start using your package locally as if you have installed it with yarn add.

### Updating your package

Since the connection is via a symlink pointing to your local package directory, if you want to make updates inside of your
package and make them visible inside the project you are testing your package in, the only thing you have to do is run:

```bash
yarn build
```

### Disconnecting from your package symlink

In order to disconnect from your package symlink the only thing you have to do is run this command:

```bash
yarn unlink "PACKAGE_NAME"
```

### Removing the Symlink

In order to remove the symlink the only thing you have to do is run this command inside your package:

```bash
yarn unlink
```

## Updating the CHANGELOG.md

Most important before publishing the design system is keeping track of the changes that you want to be published.
This ensures that everyone knows the state of the design system and what they can expect when updating their design system
package. Check out [keepachangelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) and read up on everything there as well.

### Guiding principles

Beneath are the most essential principles from the keepachangelog website:

- There should be an entry for every single version.
- The same types of changes should be grouped.
- Versions and sections should be linkable.
- The latest version comes first.
- The release date of each version is displayed.

### Types of changes

- Added: for new features.
- Changed: for changes in existing functionality.
- Deprecated: for soon-to-be removed features.
- Removed: for now removed features.
- Fixed: for any bug fixes.
- Security: in case of vulnerabilities.

### Keeping an unreleased section

To make our lives easier we should keep an Unreleased section at the top of the document to track all the upcoming changes.

This serves two purposes:

- People can see what changes they might expect in upcoming releases
- At release time, you can move the Unreleased section changes into a new release version section.

## Updating package version

We use the [semver](https://semver.org/) way of updating the version of our packages, make sure to read up on semver so
everyone understands what the version numbers mean.

We use the [yarn version](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/version) command to update the version numbers.

### Bumping the patch number

- MUST be incremented if only backward-compatible bug fixes are introduced.

A bug fix is defined as an internal change that fixes incorrect behavior.

**_Custom script to bump the patch version_**

```bash
yarn bump-patch-version
```

**_The script above executes the following:_**

```bash
yarn version --patch && git push && git push --tags && yarn publish
```

- yarn version updates the version inside the package.json and adds a git tag with the version it is being bumped to.
- git push pushes the updated package.json
- git push --tags pushes the tags that have been added.

### Bumping the minor number

- MUST be incremented if new, backward compatible functionality is introduced to the public components.
- It MUST also be incremented if any functionality is marked as deprecated in the public components.
- It MAY be incremented if substantial new functionality or improvements are introduced within the private code.
- It MAY include patch-level changes.
- The patch version MUST be reset to 0 when the minor version is incremented.

**_Custom script to bump the minor version_**

```bash
yarn bump-minor-version
```

**_The script above executes the following:_**

```bash
yarn version --minor && git push && git push --tags && yarn publish
```

### Bumping the Major number

- MUST be incremented if any backward incompatible changes are introduced to the public components.
- It MAY also include minor and patch-level changes.
- Patch and minor versions MUST be reset to 0 when the major version is incremented.

**_Custom script to bump the major version_**

```bash
yarn bump-major-version
```

**_The script above executes the following:_**

```bash
yarn version --major && git push && git push --tags && yarn publish
```
