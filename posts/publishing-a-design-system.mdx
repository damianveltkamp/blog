## What I have learned after creating a design system

In this article, I have written down the essential steps that go into
publishing your design system. I wrote most of this as documentation for
other web developers on the project whilest working on the project.

## Local package testing

Before publishing your new package version, you would ideally test the package locally. This is
possible with [Verdaccio](https://verdaccio.org/), a tool that lets you host your packages locally via a private proxy registry.

### Starting your private proxy registry

In order to start your private proxy registry, you will have to install Verdaccio as a global package. You can do this with yarn or npm:

#### yarn

```bash
  yarn global add verdaccio
```

#### npm

```bash
  npm install --global verdaccio
```

After installing Verdaccio you can start your server by running this command in your terminal:

```bash
  verdaccio
```

Now there should be a server running on http://localhost:4873/ where you can see all the packages you have published to this private proxy registry.

### Adding a user for your registry

In order to be able to publish packages to your local registry you will have to create a user, you can do this with the following command:

```bash
  npm adduser --registry http://localhost:4873/
```

### Publishing to your private registry

In order to publish your package to your local registry you can use this helper script:

```bash
  yarn test-local
```

This command runs the following script:

```bash
  npm publish --@mws:registry=http://localhost:4873
```

### Unpublishing your package from the private registry

In order to unpublish your package from your private registry you can use this helper script:

```bash
  yarn test-local-reset
```

This command runs the following script:

```bash
  npm unpublish --force @mws/mds --@mws:registry=http://localhost:4873
```

</ContentBlock>

### Using your local package in a project

In order to use the package from your local registry you first have to edit the projects .npmrc file. This file should have a predefined registry in it that should be commented out, before trying to install a package from your local registry.

TODO ADD IMAGE
ALT TEXT: npmrc file inside maandag public project

After you have commented out the registry inside the .npmrc file you can install your package with the following command:

```bash
  yarn add --registry http://localhost:4873 @mws/mds
```

After you are done testing do not forget to uncomment the registry inside your .npmrc file.

## Updating the CHANGELOG.md

Most important before publishing the design system is keeping track of the
changes that you want to be published. This ensures that everyone knows the
state of the design system and what they can expect when updating their
design system package. Check out
[keepachangelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) and read up on
everything there as well.

### Guiding principles

Beneath are the most essential principles from the keepachangelog website:

- There should be an entry for every single version.
- The same types of changes should be grouped.
- Versions and sections should be linkable.
- The latest version comes first.
- The release date of each version is displayed.

</ContentBlock>

<ContentBlock>

### Types of changes

- Added: for new features.
- Changed: for changes in existing functionality.
- Deprecated: for soon-to-be removed features.
- Removed: for now removed features.
- Fixed: for any bug fixes.
- Security: in case of vulnerabilities.

</ContentBlock>

<ContentBlock>

### Keeping an unreleased section

To make our lives easier we should keep an Unreleased section at the top of
the document to track all the upcoming changes. This serves two purposes:

- People can see what changes they might expect in upcoming releases
- At release time, you can move the Unreleased section changes into a new release version section.

## Updating package version

We use the [semver](https://semver.org/) way of updating the version of our
packages, make sure to read up on semver so everyone understands what the
version numbers mean. We use the [yarn
version](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/version) command to update
the version numbers.

### Bumping the patch number

- MUST be incremented if only backward-compatible bug fixes are introduced.

A bug fix is defined as an internal change that fixes incorrect behavior.

Custom script to bump the patch version

```bash
  yarn bump-patch-version
```

The script above executes the following:

```bash
  yarn version --patch && git push && git push --tags && yarn publish
```

- yarn version updates the version inside the package.json and adds a git tag with the version it is being bumped to.
- git push pushes the updated package.json
- git push --tags pushes the tags that have been added.

### Bumping the minor number

- MUST be incremented if new, backward compatible functionality is introduced to the public components.
- It MUST also be incremented if any functionality is marked as deprecated in the public components.
- It MAY be incremented if substantial new functionality or improvements are introduced within the private code.
- It MAY include patch-level changes.
- The patch version MUST be reset to 0 when the minor version is incremented.

Custom script to bump the minor version

```bash
  yarn bump-minor-version
```

The script above executes the following:

```bash
  yarn version --minor && git push && git push --tags && yarn publish
```

</ContentBlock>

<ContentBlock>

### Bumping the Major number

- MUST be incremented if any backward incompatible changes are introduced to the public components.
- It MAY also include minor and patch-level changes.
- Patch and minor versions MUST be reset to 0 when the major version is incremented.

Custom script to bump the major version

```bash
  yarn bump-major-version
```

The script above executes the following:

```bash
  yarn version --major && git push && git push --tags && yarn publish
```
