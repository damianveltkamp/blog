excerpt: Why and how I created my design system

<ContentBlock>

During the past few weeks, I have been building some personal websites, a portfolio, a blog, and a links webpage. To keep visual consistency across these three websites, I created a personal design system.

## Core technologies I used

To create this design system, I picked these core technologies:

### Storybook

Storybook is an open-source tool that helps you build UI components and pages in isolation. Storybook also streamlines the testing and documenting of your components.

### Next

Next is my web development framework of choice. I use Next for all of my websites. That is why I needed to incorporate Next components into my design system.

### React

React is my Javascript library of choice. I use React every day to build component-based user interfaces.

### Typescript

Typescript is a strongly typed programming language that builds upon Javascript. Typescript enables me to work more confidently and enhances my developer experience.

### Emotion

I used Emotion for all my styling purposes. Emotion enables CSS in Javascript styling.

### Rollup

I used Rollup for bundling my design system into CommonJS and ES modules.

### Babel

I had to use Babel to compile my Emotion CSS in JS solutions. Babel is great at compiling code into Javascript the browser understands.

### SVGR

I chose SVGR as a transformer for my svg's. SVGR creates react components that can be used inside the design system.

### Verdaccio

I used Verdaccio as a local private proxy registry, which I used for local testing.

## Initial setup

I followed the official [Storybook guide](https://storybook.js.org/blog/get-started-with-storybook-and-next-js/) on setting up Storybook with NextJS. This process is pretty straightforward. You start by creating a fresh NextJS Typescript project with NPX:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest --typescript
```

After this process is done you initialize Storybook with NPX:

```bash
npx sb init --builder webpack5
```

## De-optimizing NextJS image component

NextJS does a lot of optimizing for its Image component, but since Storybook runs in isolation it does not know what is happening.

This is why we add the following code to our .storybook/preview.js file

```js
// .storybook/preview.js
import * as NextImage from "next/image";

const OriginalNextImage = NextImage.default;

Object.defineProperty(NextImage, "default", {
  configurable: true,
  value: (props) => <OriginalNextImage {...props} unoptimized />,
});
```

## Cleaning up the design system project

The initial setup for the NextJS app created some folders and files that won't be used in the future, so I deleted these, for example, the global styles and pages directory.

## Configuring Rollup

In order to get everything bundled up correctly I used the following plugins:

### @rollup/plugin-commonjs

This plugin converts CommonJS modules to ES6.

### @rollup/plugin-node-resolve

This plugin locates modules for using third-party modules in node_modules

### @svgr/rollup

A plugin that helps integrate SVGR with Rollup.

### rollup-plugin-peer-deps-external

A plugin that externalizes peer dependencies out of the bundle.

### rollup-plugin-postcss

A plugin that handles the integration of PostCSS with Rollup.

### rollup-plugin-typescript2

A plugin that compiles Typescript into Javascript that keeps compiler errors.

Below you can see the rollup config I used:

```js
import commonjs from "@rollup/plugin-commonjs";
import resolve from "@rollup/plugin-node-resolve";
import typescript from "rollup-plugin-typescript2";
import external from "rollup-plugin-peer-deps-external";
import postcss from "rollup-plugin-postcss";
import svgr from "@svgr/rollup";

// Import your package json
const packageJson = require("./package.json");

// Extract directory name from string
const dirname = (file) => {
  const [root, folder] = file.split("/");
  return `${root}/${folder}`;
};

const config = {
  // Define entry point
  input: "src/index.ts",
  // Define output directories and options
  output: [
    {
      dir: dirname(packageJson.main),
      format: "cjs",
      preserveModules: true,
      preserveModulesRoot: "src",
      sourcemap: true,
    },
    {
      dir: dirname(packageJson.module),
      format: "esm",
      preserveModules: true,
      preserveModulesRoot: "src",
      sourcemap: true,
    },
  ],
  // Add all dependencies as external so they do not compile into the bundle
  external: Object.keys(packageJson.dependencies),
  // Initialise your plugins
  plugins: [
    external(),
    resolve(),
    commonjs(),
    typescript(),
    svgr({ typescript: true }),
    postcss(),
  ],
};

export default config;
```

## Configuring Typescript

Below you can see the tsconfig I used

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "rootDir": "src",
    "target": "es5",
    "module": "esnext",
    "jsx": "react-jsx",
    "sourceMap": true,
    "outDir": "dist",
    "strict": true,
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "lib": ["dom", "es2019"],
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
    "jsxImportSource": "@emotion/react"
  },
  "include": ["custom.d.ts", "src"]
}
```

Most important here is to define jsx to be react-jsx and include the custom.d.ts file in which you should define the types of your theme and other module-related typings.
